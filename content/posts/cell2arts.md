This project uses CycleGAN in (Tensorflow) to perform image to image translation and make a short artsy clip combining the [fluid motion of cell](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BMKixrCCqmxqJJ6VJxF7zu1KJyetjE2w/view?usp=sharing) and aesthetic of abstract paintings. For example, see an example [video clip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Fp8pUerYc1iNXWxBsFtNVMZCc22Z5Vm/view?usp=sharing). Please view in smaller window since the videos are generated using frames of 256x256 pixels. See the [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c-tMGg52UeaOi2xyilOuW7Vp3kLkTD1hvgQzjMHomK4/edit?usp=sharing) for project detials.
