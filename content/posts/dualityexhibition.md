The goal of this project is to let the audience experience quantum weirdness through immersive installation of music and projection, as if they are the photons in the famous double-slit experiment. The core of the installation incorporates the mathematical functions and patterns that describe quantum and/or physical properties into music and visuals.   

**With** Owen Setlik, Vigilance Brandon, and Alex Levinson.
