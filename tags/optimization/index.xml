The problem is challenging due to the complexity of transportation networks, high variety and uncertain demands, and traffic dynamics. The emergence of autonomous vehicles, Internet of things, mobile communications and cloud-based computing services bring new opportunities. We exploit these technological advancements to design futuristic pickup&amp;amp;delivery systems and strategies for efficient logistics and transportation. The objective of this research paper is to minimize the travel cost (weight*distance) of a set of autonomous cars with preplanned primary routes in an environment with stockers at intersections for transfer.</description></item></channel></rss>
